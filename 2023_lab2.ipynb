        "\n",
        "1. **Sequential Method**: Design your neural network as an ordered sequence of layers.\n",
        "2. **Custom Class Method**: By extending `torch.nn.Module`, you can craft a network with more complex architectures and specific functionalities.\n",

        "\n",
        "* `Linear`: This represents a densely connected linear layer, similar to a single-layer perceptron.\n",
        "* Activation Layers such as `Softmax`, `Sigmoid`, and `ReLU`: These layers introduce the needed non-linearity into the model.\n",

For activations, it's often more convenient to use the functional components from `torch.nn.functional` rather than instantiate separate layer objects."

        "   - The optimizer of choice is `Adam`, with a learning rate of `1e-3`.\n",
        "   - We'll also use a learning rate scheduler, `CosineAnnealingLR`, which adjusts the learning rate using a cosine annealing schedule.\n",

        "   - For each epoch, we put our model into training mode with `model.train()`.\n",
        "   - We iterate over batches of data from our `train_loader`, sending the data to the GPU (with `.cuda()`), normalizing our images, and performing the forward and backward passes.\n",
        "   - The gradients are then used to update the model's weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Validation Loop**:\n",
        "   - After training, we switch our model to evaluation mode using `model.eval()`.\n",
        "   - We then evaluate our model's performance on the validation set. This involves forwarding our data through the model and computing the loss and accuracy.\n",
        "   - The predictions are obtained by applying a threshold of `0.5` to the output sigmoid probabilities.\n",

        "5. **Learning Rate Adjustment**:\n",

Each stage, including data normalization, labeling, and the selection of appropriate loss functions for specific tasks, is underscored for its significance.\n",

        "2. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**:\n",
        "   - Beyond just training, the tutorial underscores the importance of evaluating the trained model on unseen data and visualizing its performance metrics (like accuracy and loss). Such visualizations are instrumental in discerning model behavior across epochs, ensuring it's learning effectively and isn't succumbing to overfitting or underfitting.\n"
